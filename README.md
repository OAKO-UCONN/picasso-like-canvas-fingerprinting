# Picasso based canvas fingerprinting
Implementation of a canvas fingerprinting algorithm inspired by the [Picasso paper](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45581) written by Elie Bursztein.

An online demo is available on [my blog](https://antoinevastel.com/browser%20fingerprinting/2019/03/21/picasso-canvas-fingerprinting.html).
